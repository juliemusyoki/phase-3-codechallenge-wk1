# Toy Problems Week 1,Phase 3,by Juliet Musyoki - 11/24/2023

## Project Description

### Time-Converter

This project involves creating a function that can convert a given 12-hour time to its equivalent in the 24-hour format. Users will input an hour (in the range of 1 to 12), a minute (in the range of 0 to 59), and a period ("am" or "pm"). The function should return a four-digit string representing the time in the 24-hour format. For instance, converting "8:30 am" should result in "0830", and "8:30 pm" should result in "2030". The goal is to adhere to conventions such as noon being 12:00 pm and midnight being 12:00 am.

### Two positive integers

In this project, you'll be creating a function that takes three integers as input (a, b, and c) and determines whether exactly two of the three integers are positive numbers (greater than zero). The function should return True if this condition is met and False otherwise. Examples include (2, 4, -3) returning True, (-4, 6, 8) returning True, and (-14, -3, -4) returning False. The aim is to design a function that accurately identifies the specified pattern of positive numbers.


### Constant value

This project focuses on creating a function that processes a given lowercase string containing only alphabetic characters and no spaces. The goal is to find and return the highest value of consonant substrings within the string. Consonants are defined as any letters of the alphabet except "aeiou". Each consonant is assigned a value from a = 1 to z = 26. The function should find and calculate the value of all consonant substrings and return the highest value. For example, for the word "zodiacs", the consonant substrings are "z", "d", and "cs" with values 26, 4, and 22 respectively, and the highest value is 26.
